# Mandatory_Training_APP

PROBLEM STATEMENT: 

The current system employed by the space force to track mandatory training is inefficient and cumbersome to the user. It lacks essential features such as notifications and direct links to the trainings, which means it takes longer to spin up
newer Guardians on their certifications and requirements. Subsequently, this causes mission delay and degrades unit readiness. 

Solution: All-in-one app that aids in navigation, and notification. This app will cut mission delay and fortify unit readiness.

USERS:

Admin: (stretch goal maybe?)

- Creates accounts
- Fixes bugs
- Handles ticket issues

Unit Training Manager:

- Oversees application and checks to see who is current on annual trainings. 
- Updates unit training requirements, web links, POCs, due dates/training cycles
- Verifies training certificates
- make comments on accounts
- view, print and convey unit readiness reports to CC

Supervisor:

- can see all guardian information from a higher level
- can comment on accounts
- Upload certifications

Guardian:

- Upload certifications w/ comments
- View Personal Training Requirements

Idea 1:
Managed by Unit Training Manager,
Users have accts created by unit,



Good clean UI that shows all the training you need in certain time frames.
Gives accecss if virtual training, gives poc if its IRL



competitors: Ugly ui, not simple, clunky, confusing, hard-to-navigate.


Function: 
Upload Certifications
Upload photos/pdfs
Notifies When Annual Training is almost due
Has navigation links to trainings
Calendar System with due date of Certifications (for specific user)

Stretch Goals:
Reporting analytics CSV push
Commenting system
Add additional admin to admin role


CORE MVP FUNCTIONS:

- NOTIFICATION

- NAVIGATION

- TRANSPARENCY (supervisor and UTM can see Guardians certs submitted.)
